"# machine_learning_assessment" 

Description of the Project 
--------------------------
In this project I researched and evaluated the Boston Housing dataset. I look at where each variable in dataset originally came from. How these data points were collected. Each variables relation to each other and their strengths a weaknesses. I look at other peoples work in relation to this dataset and at the original 1978 paper where the statistics were taken from. I also look at the original 1970 census questions. I then evaluate each individual variable using python and choose the strongest variables to build a machine learning algorithm to predict the price of housing. I also look at the  strength of the Charles River variable and weather it is a strong predictor of housing price.
